## Country by Country Reporting

The following is a discussion of the Country-by-Country ("CbC") reporting requirements implemented in Canada for certain multinational corporations.  

The Canadian CbC reporting requirements are modeled after recommendations outlined in the OECD's "Action 13: 2015 Final Report". This is one of 15 action reports released by the OECD in the 2015 to act as a comprehensive policy guide to avoid tax avoidance on an international scale. 

The purpose of the reporting requirements is to provide governments around the world with information on how multi-national organizations are structured and taxed. This information in turn will help direct governments to areas they should be focusing their auditing and policy resources. 

## Who is required to report?

The Canadian government followed the OECD guidelines and only require Multinational Enterprise groups ("MNE Groups") with revenues of &euro750 Million or more to file the CbC report. 

The OECD estimated that this threshold results in only 10-15% of MNE Groups having to report while capturing 90% of the revenue generated by MNE Groups. Canada expects that roughly 150 MNE Groups will need to file in Canada. 

## Filing Requirements

### OECD Article 13 Recommendations 

In Article 13 the OECD recommended a three-tiered approach to collecting effective transfer pricing information from MNE Groups:

1. A "master file" that provides a high level outline of the MNE Group's business operations, corporate structure, intangible assets, related party transactions and transfer pricing methodology. 

2. A "local files" that provides a more detailed look at the activities, related party transactions and transfer pricing methodologies used in each jurisdiction of the MNE Group. 

3. CbC reporting which outlines financial information about all business units in all jurisdictions of the MNE Group. 

### Canada's Implementation

The Department of Finance introduced new rules outlining the new Canadian requirements resulting from the OECD report. The rules released in 2016 only incorporated the CbC reporting requirements outlined in number three above. The master file and local file transfer pricing requirements were not implemented - instead Canada's existing transfer pricing rules would remain in effect. 

#### Country by Country Reporting Template

The prescribed form for Canadian purposes (RC4649) followed the template that was provided by the OECD in Action 13. This includes the following three tables:

1. Table I: overview of allocation of income, taxes and business activities by tax jurisdiction

2. Table II: list of all constituent entities of the MNE group included in each aggregation by tax jurisdiction, including designation of main business activity

3. Table III: additional Information

The specific rules related to CbC reporting and relevant definitions are outlined in section 233.8 of the Income Tax Act.
