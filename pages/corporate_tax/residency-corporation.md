# Impact of Residency of a Corporation #

A corporation resident in Canada is subject to income tax on worldwide income earned in the year. Therefore, in order to assess the tax liabilities and reporting requirements of a corporation it's residency must be determined.

# Determining the Residency of a Corporation #

## Domestic Legislation ##

Under the Income Tax Act ("ITA") a corporation is resident in Canada if it is incorporated in Canada, resident in Canada or carried on business in Canada. 

If a corporation has been incorporated in a Canadian jurisdiction than it is a resident of Canada. The only exception to this rule is the treaty "tie-breaker" rules discussed in the Tax Treaties Section below.

If a corporation has been incorporated outside of Canadian jurisdictions it can still be a resident of Canada for tax purposes. In order to make this determination we need to examine common-law principles.

## Domestic Common-Law Principles ##

Canadian courts have determined that a corporation is resident in Canada when the "central management and control" of the corporation resides in Canada. 

No one factor can determine where the central management and control of a corporation resides - the facts of every situation should be considered when coming to a determination. Generally, the location where the board of directors holds meetings and makes decisions is considered to be the location where the management and control resides. 

## Tax Treaties ##

Where corporations operate in multiple counties there may be cases where the corporation is considered to be resident in both countries according to domestic law. In these cases there is a risk that a corporation will be taxed on income twice and face unfair tax consequences. This is one of the reasons Canada has tax treaties with many counties around the world.

Most tax treaties include "tie-breaker" rules to determine the residency of a company when it would otherwise be resident of both countries. These rules differ from treaty to treaty and so the specific treaty needs to be evaluated carefully. 

The residency determined under a tax treaty takes precedence over the determination under the domestic legislation.
