## Order of Priority

When it comes to tax research all sources are not created equal. The tax rules are a matter of law and therefore tax legislation and common law are the most important source of information. The other available sources should be used to guide you to the relevant laws and provide context for the rules. The following are the resources available in their rough order of importance. 

Pleae note that accessing and reviewing these resources is sometimes difficult for the everyday person. This is why professional advice is very important. I encourage you to seek out professional advice if you have a difficult tax scenario. If you are interested enough to be reading this you should ask them to explain the rules and understand them yourself.

### The Income Tax Act

When it comes to income taxation in Canada the Income Tax Act (the "Act") is the most important source. The Act is the legislation that outlines the federal income tax rules in Canada. Note that there are also relevant provincial acts that include specific provincial credits and tax rates. However, the taxable income calculation for the provinces generally follows the rules set out in the Act.  

All other sources are interpretations of the rules outlined in the Act and provincial acts. Many rules in the Act are very clearly defined and easy to understand by simply reading the rules - this is the preferred method for making a tax decision. However, in some cases the legislation has left definitions and rules broad in order to avoid planning around specific rules. In this case you may need to consult other sources for interpretations. 

The following sources are also helpful for explaining the rules at a high level and directing you to the relevant sections of the Act.

### Common Law - Court Cases

When there are disagreements between taxpayers and the Canada Revenue Agency (the "CRA") the issues may go to the courts. Both parties argue their case and the judge makes a ruling based on what he/she believes is the correct interpretation of the act. So when the interpretation of the Act is unclear it is useful to look to common law (court cases) to see how the interpretation holds up in court. Court cases can be difficult and time consuming to read so often the decisions and principals decided in court will be summarized in the other sources listed below.

There are different courts in Canada and the decisions in "higher" courts take precedent over lower courts. The federal courts in order of their importance is as follows:

* **The Tax Court of Canada (Informal Procedure):** This court is available for decisions where the amount in question is less than $25,000. These proceedings do not require a lawyer and a taxpayer can argue their case themselves. Decisions made at this level do not set precedent for the other courts.
* **The Tax Court of Canada:** This is the first level or courts where a formal court case will take place.
* **The Federal Court of Appeal:** If one of the parties is not satisfied with the decision in the Tax Court of Canada they can appeal to be heard by the Federal Court of Appeal.
* **Supreme Court of Canada:** The last form of appeal available if one party is not satisfied with the Federal Court of Appeal is with the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court decides on what appeals it will hear so only cases it deems important will make it to this level. 

### Finance Explanatory Notes 

When the finance department releases new rules in the income tax act they will release "explanatory notes" explaining the reasons they are setting certain rules in place. These notes are useful in determining the intention behind the rules. When you understand the intention of the rules it sometimes makes it easier to determine when the rules apply and when they may not. 

### Canada Revenue Agency Commentary 

The CRA releases different forms of commentary explaining it's administrative position on tax rules. These resources are useful to determine how the CRA views the tax rules and how they will likely react to certain tax decisions. The CRA's position is not law and can change so it can not be relied upon 100%. However, it is often valuable to follow CRA's interpretation of the rules in order to reduce the risk of being reassessed on your taxes. The commentary also provides a good description of alot of the rules for free and in plain english which is a benefit.

Some of the CRA resources available are:

* **The CRA Website:** The CRA have added alot of information to their website and outline alot of their positions in plain english on their website. 
* **IT-Bulletins:** Are documents which outline the CRA's position on certain subjects.
* **Income Tax Folios:** Are new web freindly versions on the IT bulletins - as new IT folios are released the relevant IT-Bulletin will be cancelled. 
* **Guides:** The CRA provides varios guides to help you complete filing requirements such as personal, corporate, partnership and trust tax returns.

### Third Party Commentary

Lastly, there is third party commentary which include resources such as this textbook. These resources are great for giving you a high level understanding of the rules and some tips that might be hard to find looking directly at the rules themselves. 

However these resources should not be relied upon because:

* They can easily be out of date becasue the law is changing often and court cases can change interpretations of rules.
* Often when explaining the rules, especially at a high level, a specific facet of your fact pattern may be missed. You need to look at how the rules apply to you!
* You often don't know who is writing advice you find online and there can very well be mistakes! (if you find a mistake on this site please, please send feedback using the above link)
