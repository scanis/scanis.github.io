## Introduction ##

The calculation is the same for income from a business as it is for income from property.[^income-calculation] It is based on the concept of "profit" for accounting purposes adjusted for specific provisions outlined in the tax legislation. The calculation is important because it forms the base of the calculation of income taxes.

## The Starting Point: Accounting Profit ##

The starting point for income is the profit calculated in accordance with well accepted business practices and accounting policies. In Canada this generally means the use of International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") or Accounting Standards for Private Enterprises ("ASPE") as outlined in the CPA Canada Handbook. These standards are useful because they are official accounting standards in Canada but it should be noted that their use is not a requirement and is not part of the law. Taxpayers are allowed to use any calculation of profit as long as it is in accordance with the laws of the income tax act, common law, well-accepted business principals and provides an accurate picture of the taxpayers's profit for the year.[^Canderel] 

In general, the cash basis of accounting will not be appropriate because it will not provide an accurate picture of profit. However, farmers and fisherman are allowed to use the cash basis of accounting due to the nature and uncertainty of their business.[^farmers-fisherman]

## Adjustments to Accounting Profit ##

Profit for accounting purposes is the starting point for calculating income for tax purposes. Tax legislation sets out rules for the treatment of specific items that may not align with the calculation for accounting profit. In these cases the accounting profit needs to be adjusted to be in line with tax legislation. Some of the more common differences between accounting and taxable income are discussed below.

### Depreciable Property ###

It is common in accounting to capitalize an asset and amortize the cost over its useful life. This accounting amortization is not deductible for tax purposes.[^18(1)(b)] Instead, it is replaced by the capital cost allowance (CCA) system which assigns specific depreciation rates for different types of capital assets.   

The CCA system covers all aspects of depreciable property and replaces the accounting treatment for acquisitions, amortization, dispositions and gain or loss calculations. You can read more about how the CCA system works here.
