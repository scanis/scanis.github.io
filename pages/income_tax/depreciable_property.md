## Introduction ##

For tax purposes you can generally deduct amounts paid in the year for the purpose of earning income in that year. **capital property** is property that is used to earn income in one or more years and therefore no deduction is allowed when the capital property is purchased. Instead, the timing of the deduction is determined based on the type of capital property.

Under the Canadian tax system capital property can be classified into two categories:

1. Non-depreciable capital property - includes property such as land, investments, receivables, personal-use property and listed personal property.
2. Depreciable property - includes property that should be depreciated over its useful life.

The CCA system outlines the tax treatment for **depreciable property** which is capital property that is used to earn income over a number of years. Most businesses will have some form of depreciable property and it is therefore important to have an understanding of the CCA system. 

## What is Accounting Depreciation? ##

Often companies invest in **capital assets** that help earn income over a long period of time. A capital asset could include a building to be rented out to tenants or a piece of machinery used to create products. In both cases the business is buying something that will generate income over multiple years.

These types of investments are generally depreciated for accounting purposes. That means that they are set up as assets of the business and slowly expensed over their useful lives. For example, if you bought equipment for $10,000 it wouldnâ€™t make sense to say you lost $10,000 the year that you bought it. Instead you would say that you have something that is worth $10,000 (an asset) that will lose value each year because it is being used. 

## Tax Depreciation - The CCA System ##

The CCA system sets out the tax depreciation deductible each year for capital property. Specific tax rules are required because there is judgement involved in determining accounting depreciation. For example there are several different accounting methods for calculating the annual depreciation including the declining balance and straight line methods. Also, determining the useful life of an asset is an area where judgement will impact the annual depreciation expense. 

The CCA system categorizes all depreciable property into a number of "classes".  Each CCA class has a specific depreciation rate which is generally applied using the declining balance method. The government determines this depreciation rate based on two principles:

* The **useful life** of different types of property (i.e. buildings last longer than software so have a much lower CCA rate)
* **Policy objectives** can result in lower CCA rates for property the government wants people to invest in (i.e. renewable energy production)

The other notable difference between tax and accounting is the fact that while depreciation is required under most accounting regimes the CCA deduction is discretionary. Each year the taxpayer can choose to take a CCA deduction between zero and the maximum allowed under the CCA system. 

### Common CCA Classes ###

The CCA system is comprised of a number of "classes" for different types of depreciable property. 

|Class|Name|Rate|Description|
|-------|--------|---------|
|1|Building|4%/6%/10%|Most buildings acquired after 1987 fall into class 1. Note that eligible non-residential buildings can utilize a CCA rate of 6%. Eligible non-residential buildings used for manufacturing and processing can utilize a CCA rate of 10%.|
|8|Equipment|20%|Includes certain property that is not included in another class including furnitures, appliances, tools costing $500 or more per tool, some fixtures, machinery, outdoor adertising signs and other equipment used in business.|
|10|Motor Vehicles|30%|Motor vehicles as well as passenger vehicles that are not included in class 10.1. Also includes generally purpose computer hardware that was aquired before 2005.|
|10.1|Motor Vehicles|30%|Includes passenger vehicles that cost more than $30,000 (including sales taxes) purchased in the year. Each vehicle should be listed in a seperate class.|
|12|Software & Other|100%|This class includes a number of items including china, cutlery, linen, uniforms, dies, jigs, moulds and computer software (excluding system software).|
|14.1|Intangibles|5%|Includes intangible property acquired after 2016. For property acquired before 2017 please refer to the rules on the eligible capital property regime.|
|29|Eligible Equipment|50% straight-line|Machinery and equipment used in Canada for the manufacture of goods acquired after March 18, 2007 and before 2016.|
|43|Machinery|30%|Machinery and equipment used in Canada for the manufacture of goods not included in Class 29 or 53.|
|46|Network Equipment|30%|Data network infrasturcutre equipment and systems software for that equipment if they were acquired after March 22, 2004.|
|50|Compture Hardware|50%|General purpose computer equipment and systems software that is not included in Class 29.|
|53|Eligible Equipment|50%|Machinery and equipment used in Canada for the manufacture of goods acquired after 2015 and before 2026.

### Undepreciated Capital Cost (UCC) ###

1. When new depreciable property is acquired the initial purchase price (**capital cost**) is added to the appropriate CCA Class's undepreciated capital cost ("UCC") balance. 
2. When depreciable property is sold the UCC balance of the respective class is decreased by the fair market value of consideration received on sale.

### Capital Cost Allowance (CCA) ###

 
It should be noted that CCA is a discretionary deduction. That means you can decide whether or not you want to deduct CCA when calculating the taxable income for your business. 


### Undepreciated Capital Cost (UCC) ###

When a business purchases capital property it is added to the CCA Class associated with the particular property. The CCA Class determines at what rate the asset is depreciated along with other specific rules. 

This initial cost of a depreciable property is referred to as the "capital cost" of the property.
