## Introduction ##

Generally the Income Tax Act ("ITA") allows the deduction of amounts paid for the purpose of earning income in the year. **Capital property** is property that is used to earn income in one or more years and therefore no deduction is allowed when the capital property is purchased. Instead, the timing of the deduction is determined based on the type of capital property.

The CCA system outlines the tax treatment for **depreciable property** which is capital property that is used to earn income over a number of years. Most businesses will have some form of depreciable property and it is therefore important to have an understanding of the CCA system. 

### Types of Capital Property ###

Under the Canadian tax system Capital Property can be classified into two categories:

1. Non-depreciable Capital Property - Includes property such as Land, Investments, Receivables, Personal-Use Property and Listed Personal Property.
2. Depreciable Property - Includes property that should be depreciated over its useful life and where CCA can be taken on the property according to its class. 

### What is Depreciation? ###

Often companies invest in **capital assets** that help earn income over a long period of time. A capital asset could include a building to be rented out to tenants or a piece of machinery used to create products. In both casess the business is buying something that will generate income over multiple years.

These types of investments are generally depreciated for accounting purposes. That means that they are set up as assets of the business and slowly brought into income over their useful lives. For example, if you bought equipment for $10,000 it wouldnâ€™t make sense to say you lost $10,000 the year that you bought it. Instead you would say that you have something that is worth $10,000 (an asset) that will lose value each year because it is being used (depreciation). 

## The CCA System ##

### Common CCA Classes ###

The CCA system is comprised of a number of "classes" for different types of depreciable property. 

|Class|Name|Rate|Description|
|-------|--------|---------|
|1|Building|4%|Most buildings acquired after 1987. Note that eligible non-residential buildings can utilize higher CCA rates.|
|8|Equipment|20%|Includes certain property that is not included in another class including furnitures, appliances, tools costing $500 or more per tool, some fixtures, machinery, outdoor adertising signs and other equipment used in business.|


Each CCA class is depreciated at a different rate and can include special rules. When a new capital property is purchased it is added to it's respective CCA Class - the initial cost of property is referred to as the **capital cost**. For a list of common CCA classes see here.

### Capital Cost Allowance (CCA) ###

Most CCA Classes outline a depreciation rate that is applied on the Undepreciated Capital Cost (UCC) of a class using the declining balance method. This rate is determined by the government based on two principles:

* The **useful life** of different types of property (i.e. buildings last longer than software so have a much lower CCA rate)
* **Policy objectives** can result in lower CCA rates for property the government wants people to invest in (i.e. renewable energy production) 

CCA system sets out the tax depreciation deductible on capital assets.  Determining how to depreciate and account for capital assets can often require some level of judgement from an accounting perspective. For this reason the tax legislation sets out very clear rules on how much of a deduction you can take in regard to the depreciation of capital assets. 

It should be noted that CCA is a discretionary deduction. That means you can decide whether or not you want to deduct CCA when calculating the taxable income for your business. 

### Undepreciated Capital Cost (UCC) ###

When a business purchases capital property it is added to the CCA Class associated with the particular property. The CCA Class determines at what rate the asset is depreciated along with other specific rules. 

This initial cost of a depreciable property is referred to as the "capital cost" of the property.
