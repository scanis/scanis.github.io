## Introduction

Part of Justin Trudeau's Libral party platform was a review of the taxation of private companies. Specifically their focus was on reducing the ability for high income earners to split income and generate other tax benefits using private company holding structures.  

The 2017 federal budget included a warning that they would release proposed changes to the taxation of private corporations during the year. On July 18, 2017 they released a proposal document that included both draft legislation and general proposals to address several aspects of private company taxation. 

## The New Poposals - July 18, 2017 ##

### Taxation of Corporate Reinvestments ###

#### Current System ####

One benefit of earning business income in a corporation rather than as an individual is the lower corporate tax rate. Since the income in the corporation is taxed at a lower rate more after tax earnings can be reinvested in the business. This advantage encourages entrepreneurs to reinvest their earnings in the business and help the economy grow. 

While corporations do enjoy this advantage it is important to consider the following:

* The Canadian tax system is integrated in such a way that once corporate profits are received by an individual they have been taxed at a rate very similar to the top marginal personal tax rate.
* The lower corprate tax rate is not available for investment income earned in a corporation since it will be subject to a refundable tax. This helps to ensure people cannot place passive investments in a corporation and pay a lower tax rate on investment income until the funds are distributed back to them personally. 

#### New Proposal ####

The July 28th proposal includes a suggestion for new rules to address the income tax deferral available in corporate structures. This particular proposal does not include draft legislation, but rather, is a discussion of a proposed new system of taxing passive investments held by a corporation. 

The aim of the new legislation is to eliminate the tax advantage available when a corporation reinvests surplus generated from active business into passive investments. Since active business income is taxed at a low rate there will be more money to invest in the corporation than if the surplus was distributed to individual shareholders. 

The new proposal maintains the current taxation system around private companies as is with one notable exception. Generally when investment income is earned in a corporation there is an additional refundable tax paid by the corporation and refunded when a dividend is paid to an individual. The proposal is to retain this additional tax on investment income while removing the refund available when a dividend is paid. 

In the case of income generated by a business and then retained in the corporation in the form of passive investments the system remains somewhat integrated. You have more money to invest since the corporate tax rate is lower than the personal tax rate. However, income earned in the corporation will be taxed at a rate higher than the personal tax rate to make up for the lower tax rate initially. 

This is a significant change to the integrated corporate taxation regime as it currently sounds. Specfically this would be a very punative system for anyone who contributed passive investments into a corporation since the effective tax rate will be higher than the personal tax rate if they simply held the investments themselves. 

### Income Sprinkling ###

#### Current System ####

The government has historically discouraged splitting income among low income family members in order to take advantage of the graduated personal tax rates and lower their tax burdon. Currently there are several anti-avoidance rules including:

* Kiddie tax - applies the the top marginal rate for income earned by a minor child on dividends received by a private corporation
* Attribution rules - attributes income from investments gifted to a spouse or minor child back to the original owner of the investment

#### New proposal ####

The new proposals suggest an expansion of kiddie tax to apply to a wider range of relatives and also to a wider array of income earned. 

* Kiddie tax will apply not only to minor children but also to adult children, spouses, aunts, uncles, neices and nephew
* Adults will only be included if the dividends are being paid by a business carried on by a related person
* Kiddie tax will also apply to income earned on income previously subject to kiddie tax
* Gains from property that would have produced income subject to kiddie tax
* Interest from loans to a corporation, partnership or trust in certain situations

However, in the case of indivuals over the age of 17 no kiddie tax will be applied on amoutns that are reasonable after considering the circumstances. Reasonable amounts are determined after considering the labour and capital contributions to the business. There are more strict considerations of reasonability for individuals aged 18-24. 

These new rules would come into effect in the 2018 calendar year. 

### Lifetime Capital Gain Exemption ("LCGE") ###

#### Current System ####

The LCGE is available to all inviduals disposing of a private corporation given they meet certain ownership and use tests. This exemption is in place to reward business owners for taking the risk to create a business and therefore grow the economy. The exemption can be used for all family members on an arm's length sale of qualifying property.

#### Proposed System ####

The proposal includes some additional restrictions on the capital gains exemption:

* No more LCGE for individuals under the age of 18 (also includes gains accrued while the individual is under the age of 18)
* No more LCGE on gains realized or accrued by a family trust
* No more LCGE on gains from property that would otherwise produce income subject to kiddie tax (reasonability test available based ont he gain that has a accrued based on labour and capital provided to the corporation)

These new rules will generally be effective for dispositions occurring after 2017. There are transitional rules available for adults to trigger gains in 2018 and still qualify. These transitional rules do not apply to minors where shares are not sold to an arm's length party by December 31, 2018.

### Capital Gains and Dividends ###

There are two draft proposals to avoid certain types of transactions. Both proposal is effective July 18, 2017, regardless of whiether transactions were initiated prior to July 18th.

#### Tax Basis Limits ####

When performing a transaction in a related corporate group you do not get basis in the shares to the extent it was generated in the past from a related party transaction. i.e. if a related party realized a gain on the shares.

#### Recharacterization of tax-free distributions to a taxable dividend ####
