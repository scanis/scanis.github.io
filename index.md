## What is TaxTextbook.ca?

This site is an attempt to create a comprehensive textbook for Canadian taxation. We think every Canadian should have a free resource to learn about their tax system. Without understanding taxation and tax policy it's difficult to make informed financial and political decisions. 

Taxation is a large domain and it would be irresponsible and innaccurate to say that this website will ever be an exhaustive source of information. Instead, we seek to give an overview of a subject while providing references and resources to help you perform further research.  This website is only a learning resource and does not constitute professional advice. 

## How is the TaxTextbook organized?

Since tax is such a large subject area we have divided the Textbook into subject areas. As we add more information to the textbook these categories may change as appropriate.  

### 1. Income Tax Fundamentals

This section acts as an introduction to the Canadian income tax system. The basic concepts will give you a foundation to understand high level what the rules and governing bodies are trying to achieve. With this high level understanding of the system it will be easier to understand why the in-depth rules are the way they are.  

### 2. Personal Taxation

This section will focus on the personal taxation system in Canada. This includes things like:

* How to file you tax return
* What you need to incude in your income
* Understanding credits vs. deductions
* Listing of available credits and deductions
* Personal Tax Rates
* Tax Planning considerations

### 3. Corproate Taxation

This section will focus on the corporate taxation system in Canada. This includes things like:

* Understanding what a corporation is 
* Corporate Tax Rates
* Preparing a Corporate Tax Returns
* Calculating income from a business
* Specific rules applicable to corporate structures 

## Information Sources

Wherever possible we will include references and sources for the information on the site. At the bottom of each page you will see the sources which can include the Income Tax Act, Documents from the Canada Revenue Agency, or other articles.
